        <p>I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at New York University in the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/smapp/">Social Media and Political Participation Lab</a> at New York University. I received my Phd in Political Science from Penn State University. </p>
        
        <p>I'm studying the application of statistical
        and machine learning methods to social scientific questions. In most of my
        research I deal with unstructured text data. How can use better tools to
        extract scientifically relevant information form text and how can we use
        insights form social science to improve the tools we are using?<p>

        <p>My current research focuses on methods to discover and analyze coordinated campaigns to influence political topics on social media as well as on the development of tools and methodology to allow scientists to to answer questions with social media data.  </p>

        <p>You can find all my code on <a href="https://github.com/flinder">GitHub</a> and more details on my <a href="http://fridolin-linder.com/research">research</a> page. Feel free to <a href="http://fridolin-linder.com/contact">reach out</a> if you are interested in my work.</p>
