    <h4>About</h4><hr/>
    <p>I'm a fourth year graduate student in Political Science and <a
        href="http://bdss.psu.edu/education">Social Data Analytics</a> at the
    Pennsylvania State University. I'm studying the application of statistical
    and machine learning tools to social scientific questions. In my dissertation, I study how we can use social media to get an idea how people react to refugees entering the country. My advisor is <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/desmaraisgroup/people/">Prof. Bruce Desmarais</a> and I am part of the <a href="http://brucedesmarais.com/lab.html">Governance and Administration in Networks (GAiN) Lab </a>.</p>

    <p> Check out my <a href="/cv/index.html">CV</a> and <a href="/research.html">research page</a> for more information on my work. You can also find my code on <a href="https://github.com/flinder">github</a>. </p>
