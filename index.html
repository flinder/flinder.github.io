    <h4>About</h4><hr/>
    <p>I'm a third year graduate student in Political Science and <a
        href="http://bdss.psu.edu/education">Social Data Analytics</a> at the
    Pennsylvania State University. I'm studying the application of statistical
    and machine learning tools to social science questions. My projects focus on
    the application of modern text analysis tools to social media content, legislative and human rights text and the measurement of social scientific concept such as ideology. My advisor is <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/desmaraisgroup/people/">Prof. Bruce Desmarais</a> and I am part of the <a href="http://sites.psu.edu/desmaraisgroup/">Interdependence in Governance and Policy Lab</a>.</p>

    <p> Check out my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a> and <a href="/research.html">research page</a> for more information on my work. You can also find (almost) all of my code on <a href="https://github.com/flinder">github</a>. </p>

    <p> I'm always looking for potential projects and collaborators, so if you are interested in my work just send me an <a href="mailto:fridolin.linder@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
