    <p>I'm a fifth year graduate student in Political Science and <a
        href="http://bdss.psu.edu/education">Social Data Analytics</a> at the
    Pennsylvania State University. I'm studying the application of statistical
    and machine learning tools to social scientific questions. In most of my
    research I deal with unstructured text data. How can use better tools to
    extract scientifically relevant information form text and how can we use
    insights form social science to improve the tools we are using?<p>


    <p>In my dissertation, I study how we can use social media to gauge how
    people react to refugees entering a country. I address how we can find the relevant
    sub-population on Twitter that talks about the issue and provide software
    (<a href="">Active Stream</a>) to do so on the Twitter Stream. I then use that
    data to analyze if we can measure individual reactions to refugee allocations in
    Germany. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>12/02/2017: <a href="https://github.com/desmarais-lab/NetworkInference">NetworkInference</a> version 1.1.2 now available on <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=NetworkInference">CRAN</a>. Much faster and new <a href="https://github.com/desmarais-lab/NetworkInference/releases">features</a>.
        <li>08/25/2017: New working paper: <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3026393">Improved Data Collection from Online Sources Using Query Expansion and Active Learning</a> available on SSRN.
        <li>05/27/2017: <a href="https://github.com/desmarais-lab/NetworkInference">NetworkInference</a> released: An R Package that implements the <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/netinf/"><tt>netinf</tt></a> algorithm. It allows you to estimate latent diffusion networks from time stamped events accross nodes (e.g. policy adoption in states). Here's a little <a href="/software/2017/03/27/networkinference-tutorial.html">Tutorial</a> to get started.</li>
        <li>04/29/2017: I present our paper <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2812607">Text as Policy: Measuring Policy Similarity through Bill Bill Text Reuse</a> at the <a href="http://qssi.psu.edu/new-faces-in-political-methodology-conference">New Faces in Political Methodology Conference</a>.</li>
