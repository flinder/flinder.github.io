            <h4>Text as Policy: Measuring Policy Similarity Through Bill Text
                Reuse</h4>

        <p> We propose the use of <a style="color:#999" href="http://fridolin-linder.com/2016/03/30/local-alignment.html">text-sequencing
           algorithms</a>,
        applied to legislative text, to identify bills that introduce similar
        policy proposals. We present three ground truth tests, applied to a
        corpus of 500,000 bills from US-state legis- latures. First, we show
        that bills introduced by ideologically similar sponsors are more likely
        to exhibit a high degree of text reuse. Second, we show that bills clas-
        sified by the National Council of State Legislatures as covering the
        same policies exhibit a high degree of text re-use. Third, we show that
        rates of text reuse across state borders correlate strongly with the
        diffusion networks recently introduced by Desmarais, Harden and Boehmke
        (2015).</p>

            <h4>Privacy Protection for Natural Language</h4>

        <p>Redaction has been the most common approach to protecting text data, but synthetic data presents a potentially more reliable alternative for disclosure control. By producing new sample values which closely follow the original sample distribution but do not contain real values, privacy protection can be improved while utility from the data for specific purposes is maintained. We extend the synthetic data approach to natural language by developing a neural generative model for such data. We find that the synthetic models outperform simple redaction on both comparative risk and utility.

            <h4>Exploratory Data Analysis with Random Forest</h4>
        </a>

        <h6>with <a href="http://zmjones.com">Zachary M. Jones</a></h6>

        <p>We introduce Random Forest with an emphasis on its practical application for exploratory analysis and substantive interpretation. We provide intuition as well as technical detail about how Random Forests work, in theory and in practice, as well as empirical examples from the literature on American and comparative politics. Furthermore, we provide software implementing the methods we discuss, in order to facilitate their use.

            <h4>Bias in Ideological Self and Party Placement</h4>

        <h6> </h6>

        <p>
        In two experiments I show that individuals bias their reported ideological position in a survey, when they are asked to report their own and their preferred party's position together.

        <p> In this project we investigate the feasibility of several parallelization methods for bayesian estimation of IRT models. We compare them to variational and subsampling methods.</p>
