##Flying to Germany 

Our wedding is at the Hesperidengarten https://hesperidengarten.de/ , which is right outside of Frido's hometown of Regensburg, Bavaria (the Texas of Germany). Munich is about one and a half hours away via train, and Frankfurt is about three and a half hours away via train. Here are some pros and cons of flying into these airports:

Munich
* Closer to ultimate destination (by about two hours)
* Is its own destination, lovely city with lots to do

Frankfurt
* Usually has much cheaper flights (especially out of LGA and EWR)
* Has the advantage of the train station being connected with  the airport (which is wonderful after a long flight)

##Getting around Germany

Renting a car and traveling by the German train system https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml?dbkanal_001=L16_S02_D001_KSE0001_AdwInt_USA_LZ01&s_kwcid=AL!198!3!199838297414!b!!g!!%2Bdeutsche%20%2Bbahn&gclid=CjwKCAiAqIHTBRAVEiwA6TgJw5f_dZjPUoQChjPquFVOF0bfm7XRIXiNX3lYdIN1HkbcZ7UpehnUSBoCZzUQAvD_BwE  are both viable options. Pros and cons of both:

Car Rental
*Flexibility regarding timeline and destinations
*Opportunity to drive without limits on the Autobahn! (Pro or con depending on attitude.) Please consult this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3h2Rw1mHew for details.
*Need to account for parking
*Might be jetlagged the first few days

Train
*Relaxed, nice view
*Might be more expensive (book earlier to get much cheaper fare)
*Will need a mode of transportation upon arrival

*Dates are day/month/year
*Prices depend on four factors: 1. whether or not you will reserve a seat (having a ticket does not necessarily ensure you will have a seat) 2. Class you want to travel in 3. Whether or not you want to be able to change anything about your reservation (eg. time) 4. How early in advance you book
*Frankfurt (M) Flughafen is the train station connected to the Frankfurt airport

##Things to consider

Dates are usually day/month/year instead of month/day/year (especially important when booking a train)

Paying
*Although some places will accept major credit cards, cash is more reliable.
*Paying at a restaurant is a strange affair for an American. At the end of a meal a waiter will tell you how much your meal costs, and you calculate right then how much tip on top of that you would like to give. If paying in cash, you tell them how much change you want back (having accounted for your tip), and if paying in credit card you can just say "I would like to tip _ amount." Tip 10% at a restaurant for good service. Anywhere else (bars, cafes, etc) you can tip fifty cents to a dollar. Maybe American-sized tips will help assuage anti-Trump sentiment. 
*Most banks will charge you a fee to withdraw cash abroad, so keep that in mind. Make large purchases in credit card and smaller purchases in cash. You can check with your bank at home to see if they will do a free currency exchange for you before you leave the US - it's good to arrive already with a few hundred euros in hand.

Jetlag
*Try not to sleep until the evening, and get up before 10 the next day. It's easier if you get outside.
*Learn from my mistakes, and when traveling the first day after arrival, set an alarm for yourself so that if you fall asleep you still won't miss getting on/off your train.
